I highly recommend: 
> Grilled octopus - "Octapodaki tou Yiorgou - grilled octopus with lemon, oregano & olive oil"

> Dessert: Kataifi Ekmek - often not on the menu, you have to ask for it. Semolina custard is absurdly tasty.

## Mason Pacific
#### 1358 Mason St, San Francisco, CA 94133
<p> Quintessential Californinan style restaurant. Incredible attention to detail - from the design, to the way the staff describes items on the menu, to ofcourse the food. </p>

## Beretta

<p> Open super late, long waits at dinner time but get can walk in and get a table later in the evening. 
Great vibe - always buzzing with folks, good for a first date or to hang out late with a few friends. Pretty cheap for sf. </p>
> <p> The mushroom pizza is excellent </p> 
> <p> The salted olive oil ice cream is excellent </p>

## Le Garage
#### 85 Liberty Ship Way #109, Sausalito, CA 94965

They are known for their oysters, and they live up the reputation. Surprisingly cheap and filling! </p>
