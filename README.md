<p> Warm, romantic ambiance, attentive service, drool-worthy food. The best restaurant in SF.</p>
I highly recommend: 
Grilled octopus - "Octapodaki tou Yiorgou - grilled octopus with lemon, oregano & olive oil"

<p> Dessert: Kataifi Ekmek - often not on the menu, you have to ask for it. Semolina custard is absurdly tasty. </p>

<p> Quintessential Californinan style restaurant. Incredible attention to detail - from the design, to the way the staff describes items on the menu, to ofcourse the food. </p>

<p> Open super late, long waits at dinner time but get can walk in and get a table later in the evening. 
Great vibe - always buzzing with folks, good for a first date or to hang out late with a few friends. Pretty cheap for sf. </p>
- The mushroom pizza is excellent 
- The salted olive oil ice cream is excellent

<p> Tucked away and a bit hard to find, but a lovely atmosphere during the day or night.
They are known for their oysters, and they live up the reputation. Surprisingly cheap and filling! </p>
